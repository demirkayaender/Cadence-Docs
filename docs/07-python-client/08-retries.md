# Retries

Retries are opt-in. Cadence does not retry an activity or workflow unless you attach a `RetryPolicy`. Once configured, the Cadence server records and schedules attempts durably, including after worker or server restarts.

## RetryPolicy

`RetryPolicy` is a `TypedDict` defined in `cadence.workflow`. All fields are optional in the TypedDict definition, but `initial_interval` is required by the server, and at least one of `maximum_attempts` or `expiration_interval` must be non-zero.

```python
from datetime import timedelta
from cadence.workflow import RetryPolicy

policy = RetryPolicy(
    initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=1),     # delay before first retry
    backoff_coefficient=2.0,                   # multiply delay by this each attempt
    maximum_interval=timedelta(minutes=5),     # cap the delay
    maximum_attempts=5,                        # stop after 5 total attempts
    non_retryable_error_reasons=["InvalidInput"],
    expiration_interval=timedelta(hours=1),    # stop retrying after 1 hour
)
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `initial_interval` | Delay before the first retry. Required; must be greater than zero. |
| `backoff_coefficient` | Multiplier applied to delay on each attempt. Must be >= 1.0. Server default when unset: 2.0. |
| `maximum_interval` | Cap on retry delay. Must be >= `initial_interval`. If unset, no cap is applied. |
| `maximum_attempts` | Stop after this many total attempts. 0 means unlimited; requires `expiration_interval` to be set. |
| `non_retryable_error_reasons` | Error reason strings that bypass retries immediately. |
| `expiration_interval` | Stop retrying after this wall-clock duration. |

`initial_interval` is required. At least one of `maximum_attempts` or `expiration_interval` must be specified; the server rejects a policy where both are zero.

## Applying to an activity

Pass `retry_policy` in the activity options inside a workflow:

```python
from cadence.workflow import execute_activity, RetryPolicy

result = await execute_activity(
    "fetch_order",
    dict,
    order_id,
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(
        initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=1),
        maximum_attempts=3,
        non_retryable_error_reasons=["OrderNotFound"],
    ),
)
```

## Applying to a child workflow

```python
from cadence.workflow import execute_child_workflow, RetryPolicy

result = await execute_child_workflow(
    "ProcessOrderWorkflow",
    str,
    order_id,
    task_list="order-workers",
    execution_start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(hours=1),
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(
        initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=1),
        maximum_attempts=2,
    ),
)
```

## Non-retryable errors

Set `non_retryable_error_reasons` to a list of error reason strings. When an activity raises an exception whose string representation matches one of these reasons, the retry stops immediately and the error propagates to the workflow.

```python
retry_policy=RetryPolicy(
    initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=1),
    maximum_attempts=10,
    non_retryable_error_reasons=["InvalidInput", "Unauthorized"],
)
```
