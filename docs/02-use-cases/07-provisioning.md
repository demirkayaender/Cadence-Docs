Provisioning a new datacenter or a pool of machines in a public cloud is a potentially long running operation with
a lot of possibilities for intermittent failures. The scale is also a concern when tens or even hundreds of thousands of resources should be provisioned and configured. One useful feature for provisioning scenarios is Cadence support for routing :activity: execution to a specific process or host.

A lot of operations require some sort of locking to ensure that no more than one mutation is executed on a resource at a time.
Cadence provides strong guarantees of uniqueness by business ID. This can be used to implement such locking behavior in a fault tolerant and scalable manner.

## Samples

These samples demonstrate the two techniques described above rather than a complete provisioning system:

| Sample | Description | Code |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Locking by business ID** | Mutex workflow that serializes mutations on a shared resource | [Go](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-samples/tree/master/cmd/samples/recipes/mutex) |
| **Host-specific task routing** | Routes activities to a specific host through a host task list | [Go](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-samples/tree/master/cmd/samples/fileprocessing) · [Java](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-java-samples/tree/master/src/main/java/com/uber/cadence/samples/fileprocessing) |
