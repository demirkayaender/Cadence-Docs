Cadence is a new developer friendly way to develop distributed applications.

It borrows the core terminology from the workflow-automation space. So its concepts include [workflows](01-workflows.md) and [activities](02-activities.md). :workflow:Workflows: can react to [events](03-events.md), wait durably with [timers](17-timers.md), and return internal state through [queries](04-queries.md).

The [deployment topology](05-topology.md) explains how all these concepts are mapped to deployable software components.

The [HTTP API reference](10-http-api.md) describes how to use HTTP API to interact with Cadence server.
