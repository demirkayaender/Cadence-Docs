Cadence is a fault-tolerant, stateful workflow engine for orchestrating long-running distributed applications. It replaces the patchwork of databases, queues, cron jobs, and microservice glue code that most teams use today to coordinate multi-step business processes, replacing it with plain code.

A workflow in Cadence is a durable function. It can run for seconds or years, survive server restarts, retry failed downstream calls automatically, and receive external events, all without the developer managing any of that infrastructure. Cadence handles durability, retries, timeouts, and state recovery transparently, so the business logic stays in one place.

---

## What a workflow engine does

A workflow engine moves a process through a defined sequence of steps while guaranteeing that every step eventually completes, failures are retried, and the current state is always recoverable. Without a dedicated engine, teams typically stitch this together from several systems.

| Capability | Ad hoc queue + DB approach | Cadence workflow engine |
|---|---|---|
| Durable state across steps | Rows in a database, updated by each worker | Implicit: Cadence replays event history automatically |
| Retry on failure | Custom retry logic per task, often inconsistent | Built-in exponential retry with configurable policy per activity |
| Long-running timers | External timer service or cron + DB polling | `workflow.Sleep()`: sleeps for minutes or years, no polling |
| Event-driven branching | Pull from queue, check DB state, route | `workflow.GetSignalChannel()`: receive signals directly in workflow code |
| Visibility into running processes | Query multiple tables and join | Query workflow state directly via the Cadence UI or API |
| Compensation (saga rollback) | Hand-rolled, easy to get wrong | Activities are cancellable; saga pattern is a few lines of Go or Java |
| Scalability | Each component scales independently; coordination is the bottleneck | Horizontal workers; Cadence cluster handles millions of open workflows |

## How Cadence differs from queue + database patterns

The standard alternative to a workflow engine is to center coordination around a database and a message queue. A worker polls a queue, executes an action, updates a row, and pushes downstream messages. This works for simple flows, but it fractures state across tables, makes the execution history invisible, and turns every failure scenario into a bespoke retry loop.

Cadence takes a different approach. The entire process, including its state, timer, retries, and event handling, lives in a single durable function called a workflow. The Cadence server persists a log of every event the workflow produces. When a worker dies and restarts, the server replays that log to reconstruct the exact in-memory state of the workflow. The developer never writes checkpoint or recovery code.

The subscription management example below illustrates the difference. The full business logic (charge a customer monthly, handle cancellation, send emails) fits in a single function. If the billing service goes down for two days, the workflow simply waits. When the service recovers, execution resumes exactly where it stopped.

    if err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, SendWelcomeEmail, customerID).Get(ctx, nil); err != nil {
        return err
    }

    cancelCh := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, "cancel")

    for i := 0; i < MaxBillingPeriods; i++ {
        selector := workflow.NewSelector(ctx)

        for (int i = 0; i < MAX_BILLING_PERIODS; i++) {
            Workflow.await(BILLING_PERIOD, () -> cancelled);

            if (cancelled) {
                activities.sendCancellationEmail(customerId);
                return;
            }
            activities.chargeCustomer(customerId, i);
        }
        activities.sendSubscriptionOverEmail(customerId);
    }

    @Override
    public void cancelSubscription() {
        cancelled = true;
    }
}

This is the complete orchestration logic. There is no scheduler, no polling loop, no state machine table, and no hand-rolled retry code.

## Core concepts

Cadence is built on four primitives that compose cleanly with each other.

| Concept | What it is | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| **Workflow** | A durable, stateful function that defines the process. Survives restarts; code must be deterministic. | [Workflows](/docs/concepts/workflows) |
| **Activity** | A unit of non-deterministic work (API call, DB write, email send). Retried independently of the workflow. | [Activities](/docs/concepts/activities) |
| **Task List** | A named queue that routes work to the right pool of workers. | [Task Lists](/docs/concepts/task-lists) |
| **Worker** | A process that polls a task list, executes workflows and activities, and reports results back to the Cadence server. | [Deployment Topology](/docs/concepts/topology) |

The Cadence server itself is stateless. All durable state is stored in the configured persistence layer (Cassandra, MySQL, or Postgres).

:::caution Workflows must be deterministic
Workflow code is replayed from its event history every time a worker picks it up. Any non-deterministic call (random numbers, `time.Now()`, direct HTTP requests, file reads) will produce a different result on replay and corrupt the workflow state. Put all side effects in activities. Use `workflow.Now()` and `workflow.Sleep()` instead of the standard library equivalents.
:::

## Starting a workflow

Starting a workflow requires a client pointed at the Cadence frontend service. The call is non-blocking: the client enqueues the workflow and returns a run ID immediately. The worker picks it up asynchronously.

<TabItem value="go" label="Go">

```go
import "go.uber.org/cadence/client"

c, err := client.NewClient(cadenceServiceClient, domain, &client.Options{})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

we, err := c.StartWorkflow(ctx, client.StartWorkflowOptions{
    ID:                           "subscription-" + customerID,
    TaskList:                     "subscription-task-list",
    ExecutionStartToCloseTimeout: 365 * 24 * time.Hour,
}, SubscriptionWorkflow, customerID)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
log.Printf("started workflow: id=%s run_id=%s", we.ID, we.RunID)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(
    new Thrift2ProtoAdapter(IGrpcServiceStubs.newInstance()),
    WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder().setDomain(DOMAIN).build()

WorkflowOptions options = new WorkflowOptions.Builder()
    .setWorkflowId("subscription-" + customerId)
    .setTaskList("subscription-task-list")
    .setExecutionStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofDays(365))
    .build();

SubscriptionWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(
    SubscriptionWorkflow.class, options
);

// Non-blocking start: returns immediately.
WorkflowClient.start(workflow::manageSubscription, customerId);
```

## Production topology

A Cadence cluster has four services: **Frontend** (API gateway), **History** (per-workflow state machine), **Matching** (task list routing), and **Worker** (your application code). The first three are operated by the platform team; you only run the Worker.

For deployment options (SQLite for local dev, Docker Compose, Kubernetes Helm chart, or managed cluster), see the [Server Installation guide](/docs/get-started/server-installation).

:::note Cadence has no hard limit on open workflow instances
The Cadence server is designed for millions of concurrently open workflows. Scalability is a function of your persistence tier and worker count, not the engine itself.

## Use case patterns

Cadence is a general-purpose workflow engine that fits a wide range of distributed application patterns:

- **Service orchestration**: chain microservice calls with automatic retries and saga rollback. [Orchestration →](/docs/use-cases/orchestration)
- **Periodic execution**: replace cron + DB with a durable timer inside a workflow. [Periodic execution →](/docs/use-cases/periodic-execution)
- **Event-driven applications**: receive signals from external systems and branch on them inside the workflow. [Event-driven →](/docs/use-cases/event-driven)
- **Long-running business processes**: subscriptions, multi-day approvals, infrastructure provisioning. [Operational management →](/docs/use-cases/operational-management)

## Using Cadence from Go, Java, or Python

Cadence maintains production-ready SDKs for Go, Java, and Python. Other language clients are maintained separately in the wider ecosystem.

The Go SDK (`go.uber.org/cadence`) is the most widely used in production. A Cadence worker is an ordinary Go binary that calls `worker.New()` and registers your workflow and activity functions. There is no special runtime, no sidecar, and no DSL; workflows are plain Go functions that happen to be durable.

```go
// A minimal Go worker registering one workflow and one activity.
w := worker.New(service, domain, taskList, worker.Options{})
w.RegisterWorkflow(SubscriptionWorkflow)
w.RegisterActivity(ChargeCustomer)
w.Start()
```

Workers can be embedded in existing Go services or run as standalone binaries. The Cadence server is the only external dependency; all workflow state is stored server-side.

- [Go SDK: Creating Workflows](/docs/go-client/create-workflows)
