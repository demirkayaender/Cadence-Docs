Fault-oblivious stateful :workflow:workflows: can be :signal:signalled: about an external :event:. A :signal: is always point to point destined to a specific :workflow: instance. :signal:Signals: are always processed in the order in which they are received.

## Samples

Runnable signal samples:

| Sample | Description | Code |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Signal handling** | Workflow that waits for and reacts to external signals | [Go](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-samples/tree/master/new_samples/signal) · [Java](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-java-samples/blob/master/src/main/java/com/uber/cadence/samples/hello/HelloSignal.java) |
| **Event accumulation** | Counter workflow that accumulates signal events | [Go](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-samples/tree/master/new_samples/signalcounter) |
| **Signal and response** | Sends a signal to a workflow and reads back its response | [Java](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-java-samples/blob/master/src/main/java/com/uber/cadence/samples/hello/HelloSignalAndResponse.java) |
| **Human task approval** | Agent workflow paused until a human approves or rejects it by signal, requires an OpenAI API key | [Python](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-samples/tree/master/python_sdk_samples/openai_samples/human_in_the_loop) |

There are multiple scenarios for which :signal:signals: are useful.

## Event Aggregation and Correlation

Cadence is not a replacement for generic stream processing engines like Apache Flink or Apache Spark. But in certain scenarios it is a better fit. For example, when all :event:events: that should be aggregated and correlated are always applied to some business entity with a clear ID. And then when a certain condition is met, actions should be executed.

The main limitation is that a single Cadence :workflow: has a pretty limited throughput, while the number of :workflow:workflows: is practically unlimited. So if you need to aggregate :event:events: per customer, and your application has 100 million customers and each customer doesn't generate more than 20 :event:events: per second, then Cadence would work fine. But if you want to aggregate all :event:events: for US customers then the rate of these :event:events: would be beyond the single :workflow: capacity.

For example, an IoT device generates :event:events: and a certain sequence of :event:events: indicates that the device should be reprovisioned. A :workflow: instance per device would be created and each instance would manage the state machine of the device and execute reprovision :activity: when necessary.

Another use case is a customer loyalty program. Every time a customer makes a purchase, an :event: is generated into Apache Kafka for downstream systems to process. A loyalty service Kafka consumer receives the :event: and :signal:signals: a customer :workflow: about the purchase using the Cadence `signalWorkflowExecution` API. The :workflow: accumulates the count of the purchases. If a specified threshold is achieved, the :workflow: executes an :activity: that notifies some external service that the customer has reached the next level of loyalty program. The :workflow: also executes :activity:activities: to periodically message the customer about their current status.

## Human Tasks

A lot of business processes involve human participants. The standard Cadence pattern for implementing an external interaction is to execute an :activity: that creates a human :task: in an external system. It can be an email with a form, or a record in some external database, or a mobile app notification. When a user changes the status of the :task:, a :signal: is sent to the corresponding :workflow:. For example, when the form is submitted, or a mobile app notification is acknowledged. Some :task:tasks: have multiple possible actions like claim, return, complete, reject. So multiple :signal:signals: can be sent in relation to it.

## Process Execution Alteration

Some business processes should change their behavior if some external :event: has happened. For example, while executing an order shipment :workflow:, any change in item quantity could be delivered in a form of a :signal:.

Another example is a service deployment :workflow:. While rolling out new software version to a Kubernetes cluster some problem was identified. A :signal: can be used to ask the :workflow: to pause while the problem is investigated. Then either a continue or a rollback :signal: can be used to execute the appropriate action.

## Synchronization

Cadence :workflow:workflows: are strongly consistent so they can be used as a synchronization point for executing actions. For example, there is a requirement that all messages for a single user are processed sequentially but the underlying messaging infrastructure can deliver them in parallel. The Cadence solution would be to have a :workflow: per user and :signal: it when an :event: is received. Then the :workflow: would buffer all :signal:signals: in an internal data structure and then call an :activity: for every :signal: received. See the following [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56615120/1664318) for an example.
