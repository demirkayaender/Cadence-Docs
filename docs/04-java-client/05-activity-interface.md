An :activity: is a manifestation of a particular :task: in the business logic.

:activity:Activities: are defined as methods of a plain Java interface. Each method defines a single :activity: type. A single
:workflow: can use more than one :activity: interface and call more than one :activity: method from the same interface.
The only requirement is that :activity: method arguments and return values are serializable to a byte array using the provided
[DataConverter](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.uber.cadence/cadence-client/latest/com/uber/cadence/converter/DataConverter.html)
interface. The default implementation uses a JSON serializer, but an alternative implementation can be easily configured.

## Samples

Runnable activity interface samples:

| Sample | Description | Code |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Single-method interface** | Minimal activity interface with one method | [HelloActivity.java](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-java-samples/blob/master/src/main/java/com/uber/cadence/samples/hello/HelloActivity.java) |
| **Multi-method interface** | Several activity methods with `@ActivityMethod` options | [StoreActivities.java](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-java-samples/blob/master/src/main/java/com/uber/cadence/samples/fileprocessing/StoreActivities.java) |
| **Interface in its own file** | Activity interface kept separate from its implementation | [Activities.java](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-java-samples/blob/master/src/main/java/com/uber/cadence/samples/calculation/Activities.java) |

Following is an example of an interface that defines four activities:

```java
public interface FileProcessingActivities {

    void upload(String bucketName, String localName, String targetName);

    String download(String bucketName, String remoteName);

    @ActivityMethod(scheduleToCloseTimeoutSeconds = 2)
    String processFile(String localName);

    void deleteLocalFile(String fileName);
}

```
We recommend using a single value type argument for :activity: methods. In this way, adding new arguments as fields
to the value type is a backwards-compatible change.

An optional @ActivityMethod annotation can be used to specify :activity: options like timeouts or a :task_list:. Required options
that are not specified through the annotation must be specified at runtime.
