Cadence completed three public community survey rounds released from 2023 through 2025. This page aggregates the questions that remained comparable across those rounds:

- [How people use Cadence](#how-cadence-is-used)
- [The scale of that work](#activity-scale)
- [Where users want improvement](#what-users-want-improved)

## How Cadence is used

Each survey asked about common Cadence use cases. People could select more than one.

| Use case | Selected |
| --- | ---: |
| Long-running workflows | 68% |
| Microservices orchestration | 42% |
| Batch processing | 42% |
| Distributed cron | 42% |
| Synchronous interactions | 32% |
| Singleton systems | 13% |

## Activity scale

Among answers that named an activity scale:

- 81% reported 1,000 or more activities per month.
- 22% reported at least 10 million activities per month.
- 6% reported 1 billion or more activities per month.

## What users want improved

The wording of the improvement question changed between survey rounds. The table combines labels only where they described the same theme. People could select more than one.

| Improvement area | Selected |
| --- | ---: |
| Documentation | 61% |
| Observability or monitoring | 39% |
| Diagnosing or debugging workflows | 39% |
| Onboarding or getting started | 32% |
| Community support and participation | 29% |

## How the research is used

Survey results are one input to project planning, alongside production usage and direct meetings with users. The [roadmap process](/docs/tech-review/day-0-planning/scope/roadmap-process) describes how the Technical Steering Committee uses those inputs when setting annual scope and accepting projects.

Current work in recurring feedback areas includes:

- [Get started guide](/docs/get-started)
- [Monitoring documentation](/docs/operation-guide/monitoring)
- [Workflow troubleshooting](/docs/workflow-troubleshooting)

These resources address areas identified by the surveys. Survey answers do not map directly to individual project changes.

## Method and limits

The percentages pool individual answers across all three survey rounds and include only people who answered that question. The questions about use cases and improvements allowed people to select more than one answer, so their percentages do not total 100%.

We combined answer labels only when they meant the same thing. Percentages are rounded to whole numbers. Questions asked in only one or two rounds, including databases, AI agents, CNCF confidence, ratings, writing workflows, testing, and security, are not included in the tables above.

The surveys were voluntary. Their results show the priorities and usage reported by participants, not estimates for every Cadence user.

We do not publish the raw survey files because they include personal information and written comments. We can provide a copy with personal details removed on request.
