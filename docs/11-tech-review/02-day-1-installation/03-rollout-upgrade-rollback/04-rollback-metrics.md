During a server rollout, compare each metric with its pre-rollout level. If a metric worsens and stays worse after the new version starts serving traffic, that can be a reason to pause the rollout and investigate. If the evidence points to the new version, roll back.

Start with what applications see when they call Cadence. Then check whether workflows are progressing and whether persistence and replication are keeping up.

| Area | Metric | What to watch for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend requests | `cadence_errors`, `cadence_requests` | Errors rising relative to requests |
| Frontend latency | `cadence_latency` | Regular API calls, such as starting a workflow, consistently slower |
| Canary | `workflow_success` for `workflow.sanity` | Scheduled runs no longer succeeding |
| History tasks | `task_latency`, `task_latency_queue` | Sustained increase in transfer or timer task latency |
| Persistence | `persistence_errors`, `persistence_requests`, `persistence_latency` | More failed or slower database operations |
| Replication | `replication_tasks_lag_gauge` | Lag that keeps rising after the new version is deployed |

## Frontend requests

Check whether Cadence is serving requests successfully. In the [frontend availability example](/docs/operation-guide/monitoring#service-availabilityserver-metrics), `cadence_requests` counts incoming requests and `cadence_errors` counts internal service errors. If errors rise relative to requests after the rollout begins, check which frontend operations are failing.

Next, use [`cadence_latency`](/docs/operation-guide/monitoring#frontend-regular-api-latency) to see whether the frontend requests your applications make have gotten slower since the rollout. For example, look at requests to start a workflow. If those calls consistently take longer than before, that may be a sign the rollout introduced a problem.

## Canary workflows

If the canary is running, monitor [`workflow_success` for `workflow.sanity`](/docs/operation-guide/monitoring#periodical-test-suite-successaka-canary). Each successful run increments the counter. If scheduled runs stop succeeding during a rollout, check which test failed or whether the canary stopped starting runs.

## History tasks

Watch `task_latency` for [transfer](/docs/operation-guide/monitoring#transfer-latency-by-type) and [timer](/docs/operation-guide/monitoring#timer-task-latency-by-type) tasks. A sustained increase can mean task dispatch or timers are falling behind. Also watch `task_latency_queue`. The [monitoring guide](/docs/operation-guide/monitoring#note-task-queue-latency-vs-executing-latency-vs-processing-latency-in-transfer--timer-task-latency-metrics) notes that it can spike during deployment when metrics are re-emitted, even if actual task delay remains low.

[History shard movements](/docs/operation-guide/monitoring#history-shard-movements) are expected while History hosts restart during a deployment and are not a rollback signal on their own. Shard movement that continues after the rollout has finished is unexpected and worth investigating.

## Persistence

Cadence stores workflow state in its persistence database. Compare [`persistence_errors` with `persistence_requests`](/docs/operation-guide/monitoring#persistence-availability) to see whether database operations are failing more often. Check [`persistence_latency` by operation](/docs/operation-guide/monitoring#persistence-by-operation-latency) to find reads or writes that have slowed down. If either worsens, check which database operations are affected and whether the change began during the Cadence rollout.

## Replication

In a [multi-cluster setup](/docs/concepts/cross-dc-replication), watch `replication_tasks_lag_gauge` during the rollout. If it keeps rising after the new version is deployed, investigate whether the rollout is slowing replication.
